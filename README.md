Project created by Rachel Carroll, Joseph Garcia, Matt Pretel

## Background:
We are wanting to create a pitch to the Phoenix Suns to adopt NFT's into their revenue stream using different ticket packages. The NBA has reached an all time low for ticket revenue in 2021 since 2012 - the majority of the NBA's revenue stream comes from advertising, merchandising partnerships (like Adidas), and television contracts. We are also hoping to increase season long loyalty with added benefits like discounts on merchandise. We built a contract using Remix and connected through MetaMask and Ganache for purchasing via a D'app on Streamlit.

Packages available for purchase through the application:<br>
* **Standard Package:** Game ticket, NFT, and 5% off Merchandise for the Season<br>
* **Ultra Package:** Game ticket, $40 F&B Package, NFT, and 10% off Merchandise for the Season<br>
* **VIP Package:** Game ticket, $$100 F&B Package, Signed Photo with Suns Team, NFT, and 15% off Merchandise for the Season<br>

## Libaries Used:<br>
* Jupyter Notebook <br>
* Solidity <br>
* Google Colab <br>
* Prophet <br>
* Streamlit <br>
* MetaMask <br>
* Ganache <br>
* Additional library: Random <br>

## Data Analysis:
During our initial data exploratino using Statistica we noticed a sharp decline in ticket revenue and sales starting in 2020 but a significant drop in 2021. This is very clearly associated with COVID-19 protocols and the limitation of audience led games. With restrictions lifting we still want to increase loyalty and ensure people choose to leave the comfort of their home to attend a live game. <br>

* This graph shows a decline in ticket revenue starting at 2020 and peak decline in the 2021 season largely due to COVID restrictions. The NBA still has strong revenue streams associated with merchandising, advertising, and television contracts which is why total revenue remained steady even though ticket revenue declined so severely.

* This graph shows even though Ticket Revenue was at an all time low in ‘20 and ‘21, total revenue was still higher than in ‘11 - ‘16<br>

## Facebook Prophet Analysis:
 <br>
We chose to do Ticket Revenue alone for our predictive analysis as that's the weakest point of the revenue stream right now for the Suns. 


# Remix Application:
We used Remix to build our Season Ticket contracts that allows a user to purchase, register, and eventually flip the NFT for sale. The .sol file can be compiled and then deployed error free.

# Streamlit Application:
Our decentralized application allows the user to see the different packages available for purchase and what is included. As stated above in the
